Lessons Learned at McHacks 2015
===============================

``` {.hidden}
- carefully evaluate your travel and accomodation plans
- don't use new technologies that are not sponsors.
- do what you are best at, bring your A game
- evaluate refactoring decisions early
```

This past weekend myself and 4 other Saint Mary's students attended McHacks 2015.
McHacks first started in 2014 at McGill university in Montreal.
Getting from Halifax to Montreal for a hackathon is an adventure.
Getting from Halifax to Montreal for a hackathon via bus, is almost a Tolkein-esque journey.
We found ourselves freezing at 2:30am in a small northern French town along the Saint Lawrence River.
It turns out that our arrival was a surprise to other bus adventurers because the highway we just came off was apparently closed from the blizzard conditions.
This brings me to lesson one.

Carefully evaluate your travel and accomodation plans.
```

Taking the bus was mostly a budget driven decision.
Flying to Montreal would have cost twice as much.
However, the bus drive was over 18 hours, and did not have wifi or even trays to support a laptop.
In other words, for most, it was a completely wasted 18 hours.
I think it would have been worth it to pay more an have a 2 hour flight than waste two days travelling.

The other effect of a 18 hour bus ride with multiple stops throughout the freezing night, is you eventually arrive at your destination very drained.
We anticipated this and went to Montreal a day early to hopefully compensate.
But since the travel day was unproductive, most of us used our 'extra' day in Montreal to catch up on work.
When the Hackathon started we were tired but fueled with excitement and adrenaline.

Do not use new and unfamiliar technologies unless they are a sponsor.
```

This lesson should be obvious.
In fact, all of us agreed on this idea well before the hackathon.
Unfortunately, we didn't stick to this, we got too excited about new tech and jumped into things we didn't know how to use.
One of these pieces of tech was [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/) a sponsor with actual developers present at McHacks.
Using tech from a sponsor company that actually has developers present is a huge boost to your chances of success at a hackathon.
Often these sponsors have dedicated prizes for the team that best uses their product.
And beyond prizes, you stand a good chance of being recognized by these sponsors and getting the chance to connect with them.
We were lucky enough to get a chance like that, but that's another story.
We also used Loopback.io, and the ionic framework for the first time.
All of our interactions with Loopback.io were positive.
The opposite is true with ionic.
I don't want to describe our issues with ionic here because they are likely unfair given our usage was a 24 hour hackathon.
I will just say that using unfamiliar technology has a large chance of hurting your progress towards the finish line.
McHacks is a huge 24 hour hackathon with participants from around the country and the United States.
We, like the winners, should have shown up ready to use the perfected tools of our craft to build something new, not try to build something new with brand new tools.

Evaluate your decisions before it is too late.
```

About 6 hours in our troubles were plentiful and growing.
We discussed abandoning the new tools and going back to what we knew best.
That was the right decision.
We still had 18 hours left.
We had already done all the planning and UI mockups anyways.
It would have been quick work to rebuild the app with or favourite tools.

In summary, what I am trying to say is, don't waste your time troubleshooting beginner problems with tech unless there is really a big chance of a big payoff.
Take full advantage of the hackathon resources, talk to sponsors, attend the technical talks, MEET PEOPLE, eat the food!
And you'll have all that much more time to do this if you stick to what you know.
Push the boundaries of what you can do with your favourite tools, make something brilliant and beautiful.

Happy Hacking.
